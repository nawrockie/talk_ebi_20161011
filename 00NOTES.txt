Abstract:
Harnessing conserved secondary structure to computationally identify RNA homologs

Some RNAs do not encode proteins, but rather function directly as
RNAs. Many of these RNAs form stable, evolutionarily conserved
three-dimensional structures that are crucial to their function. The
Infernal software package implements covariance models (CMs),
probabilistic models that take both sequence and structural similarity
into account when searching for and creating alignments of homologous
RNAs. Infernal is used by the Rfam database to annotate RNAs in
genomes and other sequence datasets. The high computational complexity
of CM dynamic programming alignment algorithms makes CM methods slow,
and has limited their practical application. I will discuss recent
improvements to Infernal, including acceleration strategies that
mitigate this complexity and make large-scale sequence searches, such
as those performed by Rfam, possible in reasonable amounts of time while
sacrificing very little sensitivity.

--------------
Tentative plan:

Beginning of JSSS talk (Jan 2014) 
- tRNA structure discovery (motivation for homology search and
  introduction to RNA secondary structure)

Somewhere about the middle transition to modern (Nov 2015 RNA club)
talk that culminates in removing BLAST filters

Finish with recent improvements to Infernal:
 - cmscan saves profiles instead of re-reading
 - clan overlaps 

----------
Getting a skeleton set of slides that I can do a walkthrough of and
modify as necessary:

ON MACBOOK PRO:

<[talk_ebi_20161011]> pwd
/Users/nawrockie/Dropbox/work/notebook/16_0909_talk_infernal_ebi/talk_ebi_20161011

cp: ../../13_1216_talk_janelia_jsss/latex/figs/bkups is a directory (not copied).

Papers to read before giving talk:
Holley 1965
snoRNA paper (if I keep it in)

=================================
EPN, Wed Oct  5 11:34:59 2016

Still to do for the slides:

- Find some info about what parts of SSU are responsible for what, or
  drop that slide.
 
- Finish 1.1.2 module:
  - build slides with old timings
  - rerun experiments to update timings
  - do nhmmer experiments

- Walkthroughs
