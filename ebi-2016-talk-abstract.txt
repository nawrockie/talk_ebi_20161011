Harnessing conserved secondary structure to computationally identify RNA homologs

Some RNAs do not encode proteins, but rather function directly as
RNAs. Many of these RNAs form stable, evolutionarily conserved
three-dimensional structures that are crucial to their function. The
Infernal software package implements covariance models (CMs),
probabilistic models that take both sequence and structural similarity
into account when searching for and creating alignments of homologous
RNAs. Infernal is used by the Rfam database to annotate RNAs in
genomes and other sequence datasets. The high computational complexity
of CM dynamic programming alignment algorithms makes CM methods slow,
and has limited their practical application. I will discuss recent
improvements to Infernal, including acceleration strategies that
mitigate this complexity and make large-scale sequence searches, such
as those performed by Rfam, possible in reasonable amounts of time while
sacrificing very little sensitivity.
